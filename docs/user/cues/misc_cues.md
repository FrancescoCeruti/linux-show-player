Cues that donâ€™t fit others categories

## Command Cue

This cue allow to execute a shell command, until the command runs the cue is
`running` and can be stopped, doing so will terminate the command.

To see the command output, LiSP should be launched from a terminal, and
`Discard command output` must be disabled.

```{danger}
The cue will execute **any** command you supply!<br>
Be sure to understand what you're doing, and avoid dangerous and untrested commands.
