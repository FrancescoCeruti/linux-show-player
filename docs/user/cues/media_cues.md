# Media cues

```{toctree}
:hidden:

media_custom_elements
```

Media cues provides playback capabilities, thanks to GStreamer we provide support for a very wide range of media formats,
and a variety of effects can be applied at runtime without modification to the source files.

```{warning}
Currently only audio playback is supported
```

## Audio Cues

Audio cues allow you to playback audio files.

```{note}
It's possible to play the audio of video files
```

### Options

When editing a media cue options, two sections (tabs) are provided,
one (`Media Cue`) has a few common options, while the second (`Media Settings`) 
provides fine-grained control on the multimedia source, output and applied effects.

```{image} ../_static/media_cue_options_tab.png
:alt: Media Cue option tabs
```

#### Media Cue

* **Start time:** Start position of the media
* **Stop time:** End position of the media
* **Loop:** Number of repetitions after first play (-1 is infinite)

Start/End time allow you to trim the media file without modifications, keep in mind that the UI will keep showing the
original file duration independently of these options.

Loops allow to replay the same media multiple times, they _should_ be seamless if the media content is seamless 
and depending on the media format, `.wav` are usually a safe option.<br>
Loops can be stopped "artificially" via a `Loop Release` action.

#### Media Settings

Each media cue is made of a sequence of elements, referred as "pipeline":

* One "input"
* Any number of "plugins" or "effects"
* One "output"

In this section both, the pipeline composition and each element options can be controlled.

```

Active elements can be changed using the **Change Pipeline** button (bottom left)

```{image} ../_static/media_cue_edit_pipeline.png
:alt: Edit pipeline
:align: center
```

```{note}
The default pipeline composition can be changed via `File > Preferences > Plugins > GStreamer`, and will apply on news cues.
```

```{note}
While editing multiple media cues at once, it's necessary to _Change Pipeline_ to select the elements to update.<br>
The pipeline itself cannot be canged in this mode.
```

## Inputs

### URI Input

Read and decode data from a file, local or remote (e.g. http, https, etc..)

* **Source:** the URI to look for data (a "find file" button is provided for searching local files)

### System Input

Get the audio from the system-default input device (e.g. microphone), no option is provided

```{note}
To use `System Input` you need to create a media cue with a file, and then change the source element.
```

## Effect/Plugins

Used for audio-processing or data-probing, in some case the order affect the results

### Volume

Allow to change the volume level, or mute the media.

* **Volume:** volume level in dB (can be muted)
* **Normalized Volume:** parameter used by other components (e.g. ReplayGain) to
  normalize the volume level without affecting user values, you can only reset the value (to 0dB).

### 10 Bands Equalizer

Allow to equalize the media with 10 frequency bands [30Hz-15KHz].

### dB Meter

Allow external components to get the current sound level, used for UI visualization.

* **Time between levels:** millisecond between one extracted value and the next (_lower values will increase CPU usage_)
* **Peak TTL:** Time To Live of decay peak before it falls back (in milliseconds)
* **Peak falloff:** Decay rate of decay peak after TTL (in dB/sec)

### Speed

Speedup or slowdown the media, without affecting the pitch.

### Pitch

Allow to change the media pitch by semitones.

### Compressor/Expander

Provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression" target="_blank">Dynamic range compression</a>.

* **Type**
   * *Compressor*
   * *Expander*
* **Curve shape:** Selects how the ratio should be applied
   * *Hard Knee*
   * *Soft Knee*
* **Ratio:** Ratio that should be applied
* **Threshold:** minimum value from which the filter is activated (in dB)

### Audio Pan

Allow to control stereo panorama (left ‚ü∑ right).

```{note}
When used the audio will be forced to stereo
```

### Custom Element

Allow to manually create a custom GStreamer "elements" using the framework syntax,
some instruction and example can be found [here](media_custom_elements.md).

## Outputs

Send the audio to an output device

### Auto

Use the system-default output device, no option is provided.

### ALSA

Output to an ALSA device

* **ALSA device:** the output device to be used

### PulseAudio

Output to the default pulseaudio output device, no option is provided.

### Jack

Output to <a href="http://www.jackaudio.org/" target="_blank">Jack</a> server.

The **Edit connections** button allow to view and change the connection for the cue:

```{image} ../_static/media_cue_jack_connections.png
:alt: Edit connection
```

On the left the cue outputs, on the right the available inputs, 
by selecting one input and one output it's possible to connect/disconnect using the provided buttons.

```{note}
Each cue will create a new connection on demand, do not rely on the given names.
```
