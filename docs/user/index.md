Linux Show Player, LiSP for short, is a free cue player, mainly intended for sound-playback in stage productions,
the goal is to provide a complete playback software for musical plays, theater shows and similar.

## Features

Here some functionality offered by LiSP:

* List layout
* Cart layout (buttons) for touchscreens
* Undo/Redo changes
* Concurrent cues playback
* Pre/Post wait
* Realtime sound effects: equalization, pitch shift, speed control, compression
* Peak and ReplayGain normalization
* Send/Receive MIDI and OSC
* Multi-language support
* Can play (almost) any kind of media file

## Project Status

Currently, only GNU/Linux systems are supported.

The application is quite stable, is already been used for multiple performances
by different people, but, due to the heterogeneous nature of the GNU/Linux ecosystem,
my suggestion is to test it in a "production" environment to detect possible problems
with some configuration.
