# Getting Started

Before diving into the different aspects of LiSP you should take a moment to understand
some of it's base concepts.

## Shows

A show, or session, is the container of everything you'll build inside the application.

## Cues

At the heart of every show, are the **cues**, used to execute specific actions,
such as playing sounds, sending MIDI messages, controlling other cues and so on.

Each individual cue allows great customization of its behaviours.

## Layouts

As the name might imply, *layouts* will determine how cues are displayed and
organized on yours screen.
They also provide different sets of features.

Every time you create a new show in LiSP you have the ability to choose a *layout*.

You can choose between two of them:

**List Layout**
    Arrange the cues in a list and provide a mouse/keyboard oriented UI

**Cart Layout**
    Arrange the cues as buttons in a grid, providing a more touch-oriented UI, supports multiple pages.

## Plugins

While this is almost always hidden from the user, most of the functionalities
of Linux Show Player are provided via plugins.

Plugins allow the more advanced users to build their own functionalities with
relative ease.
