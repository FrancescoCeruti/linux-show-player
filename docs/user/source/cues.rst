Cues
====

Cues are the main component of every show/session.
There are multiple types of cues able to perform different tasks, those can be
subdivided in two main categories:

* **Media cues:** used to play multimedia contents, usually related to some media file or stream
* **Action cues:** used to accomplish more complex interaction (e.g. start multiple cues at one),
  fading other cues parameters or interact with external devices or application.

A cue can perform different *actions* depending on its current *state*

**Actions:**
    * ``start:`` Perform the cue task, or stop it if the cue is already running
    * ``stop:`` Stop the running cue
    * ``pause:`` Pause the running cue if possible
    * ``interrupt:`` Stop the running cue, other cues/functions will ignore this event
    * ``fade:`` Decrease/Increase gradually a predefined cue parameter (e.g. volume)

Every action (except for fading) can be performed with or without a fadein/out.
