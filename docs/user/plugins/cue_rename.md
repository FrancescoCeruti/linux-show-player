# Rename Cues

This utility plugin allows to rename cues in batch, with simple buttons click or by using more advance regular expressions.

## How to use

You can access the utility via `Tools > Rename Cues`, if no cue is currently selected,
all cues in the layout will be loaded into the utility.

```

In the top list you can see the original names, and a preview of the new names.<br>
You can select/deselect each cue if you need to include/exclude some when renaming.

Under the list you'll find a set of default tools, and two input where regular expressions can be used,
for advanced use cases.

To apply the new names, confirm using the `OK` button.
