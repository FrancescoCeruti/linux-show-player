Before posting an issue:
 - avoid opening a new issue if you need a simple or a yes/no answer, use `gitter` instead
 - check if the same issue is already been reported
 - check if the enhancement is already mentioned in the `TODO project`

When writing an issue:
 - use the markdown formatting to make the issue easier to read
 - if the issue is spefic to some git version start the title with `[git]` or `[git:<branch>]`
 - don't worry about being sarcastic ;-)
 - for bugs/unexpected behavior, use the following "template"
 - remove the template text you don't need, like these first 11 lines

**Open diffrent issues for different and unrelated bugs/requests**
